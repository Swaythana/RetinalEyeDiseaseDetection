# RetinalEyeDiseaseDetection</br>
There are various retinal eye diseases which causes vision loss.Some of the diseases like Age Related Macular Degeneration, Choroidal Neovascularization and Diabetic Retinopathy which causes damage to eye. There's no cure, but with early diagnosis and treatment there is the chance to prevent a loss of vision. 
The aim of our project is to identify the features to perform feature extraction algorithm and to perform classification algorithms to detect the severity of the disease. 
The changes in optic disc and blood vessel plays major role in detection of the disease. Hence the segmentation of blood vessel and optic disc were performed.</br></br>
